EPE is one of the longest-running and most respected electronics magazines in the UK. It was founded in 1964 as Practical Electronics by IPC Magazines as a constructors' magazine for the electronics enthusiast. In 1971, it spawned a sister magazine called Everyday Electronics, which was aimed at novice-level readers. In 1986, both titles were sold to independent publishers and the editorial teams remained separate. In 1992, they were merged to form Everyday with Practical Electronics (EPE), which later dropped the "with" from its name. In 1999, EPE acquired another rival magazine, Electronics Today International (ETI), and incorporated it into its content. In 2018, EPE was sold to a new publisher, Electron Publishing Limited, which reverted the title to Practical Electronics in 2019.
