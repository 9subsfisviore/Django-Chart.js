ModelSim SE 6.5b is a powerful and cost-effective HDL simulator that supports mixed VHDL and Verilog design verification. It is developed by Siemens EDA Software and can be used for small and medium-sized FPGA designs with complex functionality[^1^]. In this article, we will show you how to install and use ModelSim SE 6.5b on your computer.
 
## Installation Steps
 
1. Download the ModelSim SE 6.5b installer from the Siemens EDA website or from other sources. Make sure you have a valid license file for the software.
2. Run the installer and follow the instructions on the screen. You can choose the installation directory and the components you want to install.
3. After the installation is complete, you need to configure the license for the software. You can use the Licensing Wizard that opens automatically or launch it from the Start menu.
4. Select "Install a license file" and browse to the location of your license file. You can also enter your license server information if you have one.
5. Click "Finish" and close the Licensing Wizard. You can now start ModelSim SE 6.5b from the Start menu or from the command line.

## Usage Steps

1. Create a new project or open an existing one in ModelSim SE 6.5b. You can use the Project Manager window to manage your files and settings.
2. Add your VHDL and Verilog source files to the project. You can also import files from other tools or libraries.
3. Compile your source files using the Compile menu or the command line. You can check for errors and warnings in the Transcript window.
4. Simulate your design using the Simulate menu or the command line. You can use the Wave window to view and edit waveforms, the Objects window to inspect signals and variables, and the Breakpoints window to set breakpoints.
5. Analyze your simulation results using the Code Coverage tool, which shows you how much of your code has been executed during simulation[^1^]. You can also use other tools such as Compare Results, Report Generator, or TCL Scripts to enhance your verification process.

## Conclusion
 
ModelSim SE 6.5b is a versatile and efficient HDL simulator that can help you verify your VHDL and Verilog designs with ease. It has a user-friendly interface, a single kernel simulator technology, and a rich set of features that make it a popular choice among FPGA designers[^1^].

- It supports both VHDL and Verilog languages, as well as mixed-language simulation. You can use the same tool for different types of designs and avoid compatibility issues.
- It has a native compiled, single kernel simulator technology that delivers high performance and accuracy. You can simulate large and complex designs faster and with less memory consumption.
- It has an intuitive debug environment that allows you to easily find and fix errors in your design. You can use graphical and textual views, interactive commands, and advanced debugging features such as breakpoints, watchpoints, and tracepoints.
- It has a comprehensive code coverage tool that helps you measure the quality of your verification process. You can see how much of your code has been exercised during simulation and identify gaps in your test cases.
- It has a flexible and customizable interface that adapts to your preferences and workflow. You can use menus, toolbars, dialogs, or command line to access the simulator functions. You can also use TCL scripts to automate tasks and extend the simulator capabilities.

## Limitations of ModelSim SE 6.5b
 
ModelSim SE 6.5b is not without limitations. Some of them are:

- It requires a license file or a license server to run. You need to purchase a license from Siemens EDA or from an authorized distributor. You also need to renew your license periodically to keep using the software.
- It does not support SystemVerilog or UVM languages, which are widely used for advanced verification methodologies. You need to use ModelSim PE or ModelSim DE editions to access these features.
- It does not support hardware co-simulation or emulation, which are useful for verifying designs with real hardware devices. You need to use other tools such as Questa Sim or Veloce Emulation Platform to perform these tasks.
- It does not support graphical design entry or synthesis, which are helpful for creating and optimizing designs. You need to use other tools such as HDL Designer or Precision Synthesis to perform these tasks.
